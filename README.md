<h1>Concept2 PM5</h1>

This is a simple package that can be used to interract with the Concept2 Performance Monitor 5. Only the Performance Monitor 5 will be used since it is the only edition with the capability of bluetooth, using *Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)*.

For now this package is in its infancy and is only published to reserve the name. It will be fully documented to allow anyone to use it in their applications and projects and hopefully flexible enough to port to the framework of your choosing.

If you are encountering any issue feel free to create an issue and I'll get too it as soon as I realistically can.
